# proctmux

A TUI utility for running multiple commands in parallel within tmux panes.

This app is intended to be a drop-in replacement of [procmux](https://github.com/napisani/procmux) for tmux users. Utilizing tmux panes/windows gives the user a more powerful and familiar environment for managing their long-running processes.

## TODO

List of features requiring development to bring proctmux near parity with procmux:

- Display:
    - sort process list
- Processes:
    - interpolation
